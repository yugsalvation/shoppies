Hello Viewer,<br/>
This was a part of the Shopify challenge.<br/>
I have built this application using ReactJS.<br/>
features: <br/>
1. Used OMDB api for data.
1. The search of a movie and getting results is completely dynamic, no button is needed to get show the results. <br/>
2. A click on the nominate button of a movie item adds it in the nominated movie list and disable that item from further addition. <br/>
3. Removing an item from the nominated movie list automatically enables the item in the search list from again getting nominated.<br/>
